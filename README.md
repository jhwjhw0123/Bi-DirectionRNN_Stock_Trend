# Bi-DirectionRNN_Stock_Trend
A small project to use Bidirectional GRU to learn stock in/decrement prediction and 20-day trend simultaneously and output the prediction of the trend

## Scripts:
Metric_Computation: Python functions to compute financial indicators <br/>
stock_data_read_process: Load and read the stock information and compute the indicators <br/>
bidirec_RNN_trend_training: The main Bi-direction RNN script to train the network <br/>
result_plotting: plot the results <br/>
